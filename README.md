 A small 3D Printed ViewSonic Monitor

This is a small, nearly quarter-scale model of a ViewSonic CRT monitor. The display is provided by a very high resolution (1600x1440 pixel) 3.5" display, originally meant for VR and head-mounted displays. The monitor may be found at [this AliExpress listing](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800748217381.html) although I make no guarantees about the permanence of that URL.

To build this monitor, you will need:

- Various hardware
	- M4 nut and bolt for base/retainer.
	- M2.5 heat set inserts and M2.5 x 8mm screws for the front piece
	- No. 2 pan head Philips screws for other mounting.
- 3D printed parts
	- Available in the /STLs folder
- The [LCD panel and driver board](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800748217381.html)

Assembly is easy; just print the parts out and screw them together. Finishing the monitor is not; I used an airbrush and waterslide decal paper, instructions for this is left as an exercise to the builder.
